# Guess-My-Number-Game
This is a small and funny game developed using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

To run this game on your machine is very simple. I recommend that you use Visual Studio Code as your code editor.
After opening the project in your code editor, open the terminal and run the following commands:
1- npm install --save
2- Install live-server: npm install -g live-server
3- Run the game: live-server

Play the game and have fun...ðŸ˜‰
